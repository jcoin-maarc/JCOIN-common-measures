The schemas in this folder describe the data collected using the JCOIN 1.0 common measures, and are used to validate data submissions and generate data packages. The file [jcoin1_client.yaml](jcoin1_client.yaml) contains all of the client variables and is the authoritative source for working with the client data. The files [jcoin_staff_baseline.yaml](jcoin_staff_baseline.yaml) and [jcoin_staff_followup.yaml](jcoin_staff_followup.yaml) were translated from the corresponding JSON files, and will likely require corrections and cleaning up before they can be used; the first contains measures *only administered at baseline*, while the second contains measures that were administered during follow-up.
