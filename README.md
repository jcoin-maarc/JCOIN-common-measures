# JCOIN Data Schemas

This repository contains [tabular data schemas](https://datapackage.org/standard/table-schema/) for data packages used by the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN). A *data schema* provides a formal description of a dataset, including (but not limited to) variable names, types, labels, descriptions, and possible values. It is both human readable but can also be used to perform useful operations such as validating a dataset or controlling the way it is imported into an analytic software package (e.g., Stata, R, or SAS).

The authoratitive schemas are maintained in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format, but may be translated into other formats as well (e.g., JSON, CSV).


## Validating Your Data

Instructions for using these schemas to validate your data may be found [here](https://github.com/jcoin-maarc/JCOIN-common-measures/blob/main/validation.md).
